# Shawarma Name Generator

A simple page that generates strings of the form `шаурма.+`, akin to some of the puns used in the names of many shawarma joints. The `ма.+` part is taken from `src/ma_nouns.txt` which contains ма-initial nouns filtered from `src/ma.txt` using [PyMorphy](https://github.com/pymorphy2/pymorphy2). `ma.txt` itself is taken from [this wonderful repository](https://github.com/danakt/russian-words).
